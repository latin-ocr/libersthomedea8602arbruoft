The Hamiltons were soon after restored, and on the llth

ageS, and teinds of the Abbey, (“ being in his Majesteis handis
be dimissioun and resignatioun maid thairof be the Abbot and
Convent of the samin,'') and erected the same into a tempora]
lordship in his favour, with the dignity and title of a Lord of
Parliament.¹ .

We are informed by John Spotiswood2 that the Abbacy of
Arbroath “ afterwards belonged to the Earl of Dysart, from
“ whom Patrick Maule of Panmure, gentleman of the bedcham-
“ ber to King James VI„ did purchase it, with the right of
“ patronage of thirty-four parish churches belonging theret0.''

Abbey during the reigns of William. the Lion, its founder, and
his son and grandson. The age of church endowments was
gone, and the Abbey RegisterS‚ after->the reign of Bruce, show

¹ Acts of Parliament. 2 Account of the Religious Houses of scotland.
