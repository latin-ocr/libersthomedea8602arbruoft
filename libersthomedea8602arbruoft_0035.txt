expenditure exceeded the charges of the old cellarer in 1488,

But the real and paramount interest of a record like the pre-

’ sent, is in furnishing directly or collaterally what may be con-

sidered the territorial history of the province. There is hardly
a barony in Angus and Mearns which does not receive illustra·
tion from the records of Arbroath ; scarcely a family of note
which must not seek its early history among the transactions of
the great Abbey. The former volume is said to have dis-
appointed the gentlemen of Angus, who expected to have found
their ancestors there chronicled. They had not considered how
many of our ancient families went down· in the War of Inde-
pendence,—how few of our present aristocracy trace back be-
yond the revolution of families and property which took place
under Bruce. The great old Earls of AnguS, Fffe, and 8116111-
6111, 616 little more than mythological personages to the modern
genealogist. The De BerkeleyS, De ValoinS, De MalherbeS,
MaulevererS, De Monte-altO, De MontefortS‚ have not even left
their high sounding names in the country they once ruled.
