xviii PREFACE.
Abbot to war, either with the northern lordS, under the Brecben·
nach—the Banner of Columba—or under the proper standard of
the Abbey itself, he was free from the common duties owed to
the superior.¹

We have little information of the early history of the Burgh
of Arbroath. With such protection for shipping as its natural
harbour afforded, it had grown up under the shelter and protec-
tion of the great Monastery, from a fishing hamlet, till it became
a place of some foreign trade in the fourteenth century. The
worthy Abbot, John Gedy, saw the advantage that would arise
to his town and the whole district, if, on that inhospitable coast,
he could transform the creek among treacherous rocks into a
tolerably safe harbour; and the covenant made between the
Abbot and the burgesses for that object, on the 2d of April
1394, as it is the oldest, is also perhaps the most curious and
interesting of the records of harbour-making and also of volun-
tary taxation in Scotland.2

² No. 42. The indenture sets forth the innumerable
losses and vexatione long and still suffered, for want of
a port where traders, with their ships and merchandise‚
might land. On the one part it is agreed, that the
Abbot and convent shall, with all possible haste, at their
expense, make and maintain, in the best situation ac-
cording to the judgment of men of skill, a safe 'harbour
(portum salutarem) for the burgh, to which and in
which ships may come and lie, and have quiet and

safe mom-ing, notwithstanding the ebb and flow of
tides. The burgesses, on the other hand, are to clear
the space fixed on from saud and stones and all other
impediments; to fin with stones and place the coffers
(archas) required for the harbour, under the direction
of the masters of the work3 to find certain tools neces-
sary for that purpose, namely, spades, iron pinches, and
tribulos, (2³) at their own expense; the other instru-
ments to be found by the Abbey. And because, in the
foundation of the harbour, much labour and expense
are required, more than the burgesses could bear,1the
burgesses shall pay to the Abbot yearly, three pennies
ofsterlings from each rood of land within the burgh,
in addition to the three pennies now paid,—the addi-
tional rent beginningsshe first year that one ship can
