xxvi PREFACE.

The only recorded covenant with a schoolmaster for instruct-
ing the novices and young brethren‚ is unfortunately silent as to
the branches of learning they were to be taught. Mr. Archibald
Lamy, the pedagogue‚ has 10 marks of salary—the customary
and almost legal stipend of a parochial vicar—besides his daily
portion with the monks¹

The ‘Advocate' of the Abbey, receiving a yearly pension of
20 marks for his counsel and ‘ advocation,' was no less a person-
age than M aster J ames Henrison, the Olerk of J usticiary‚ or, as
we write the office, Lord J astice-Clerk. ’

The supplication and 'complaint of Abbot Malcolm to Parlia-
ment and Convocation, must have been drawn by a less prac-
tised hand. It is a very curicus specimen of untechnical legal
pleading as well as of idiomatic Scotch language.²

We owe to David Betoun, on his first con'iing into the Abbacy,
some 111138 for its economy‚ which show the yearly consumption
of all supplies by the Convent. The monks used annually 800
wedders, 31111 9 80013 of martS, besides lamb and veal, swine‚
grice, and chickens 3 eggs and butter ; dried fish (keeling‚ had-
dock and spelding), large supplies of fresh 833 fish, and ll
barrels of salmon, the produce of their fishings at Dundee‚ the
Ferry (Broughty), and Montrose. The allowance of wheat was
30 0113111318, of oatmeal 40 chalders, and of malt 82 0113111318.
