xxiv PREFACE.

chancel in front of the high altar place, was at once judged to
be that of the great founder. ’ The coffin, of stone, was found to
contain only a portion of the bones of a man of good stature,
not much decayed. Its cover, of a ‘blue shelly marble, had
upon it the mutilated sculpture which is figured at the end of
the first volume.¹ It was hoped that the head and other frag-
ments os the monument might be found, but none have as yet
been discovered.

At the same time was discovered (in one of the western
towerS,) a mutilated figure of a crosiered ecclesiastic, of the fine
sandstone of the district. It is one of those effigies which stood
under the niches that ornament all our older churcheS, and is
of good workmanship for that purpose. The lace, especially, is
very elaborate and sharply wrought, and when first discovered
still preserved some remains of the gold leaf with which it had
been ornamented. It is commonly said to be the statue of St.
Thomas A'Becket, the Patron, but on no better gronnds than
the recumbent monument is ascribed to the Founder of the
Abbey. The latter, indeed, has some circumstances ·in favour
of the identification, though it must be confessed its position in
front of the high altar might suit equally well for one of the old
Earls of Angus or other munificent benefactors of the Abbey.

¹ The monument is of fine workmanship, and quite spurs and apparently the arms of knights, are engaged
unlike any other in Scotland. At the feet ia a lion, 111 arranging the robe of the principal figure. These
or some euch heraldic beast. The robe is simply aud diminutive attendants, which form the chief peculiarity
graoefully draped, and the waist girt with a narrow of the monument, recallin some degree the attendant

belt, to which is attached a pouch or purse. Small Saints on· the tomb of King John in worcester
figures, at least four in number, and having the cathedral.
