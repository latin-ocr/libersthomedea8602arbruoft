PREFACE.

Rothiemay, prepared as the foundation of a majp for the Sootoh
volume of Blaeu's great Atlas It is well known that the map of
Angus is wanting in that most valuable collection ; and the map
subsequently printed by Edwards, minister of Murroes, with a ’

Arbroath. The legend is :—

SIGILL. ABBATIS SOI. THOME DE ABIRBROTHOC.l

On the leaf opposite the title is the fine round chapter-sea] of

have found'on two of the shields the arms of Fitzurse (a bear
rampant), and of Traoy (two bends).

The counter-seal of this stamp, not here engraved, represents
a shrine with the folding-doors open, displaying the Virgin and
child seated and orowned. The legend, which is not found legi-
